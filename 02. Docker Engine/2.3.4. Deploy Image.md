# 2.3.4. Deploy Image

## How to deploy Docker Images?
### 1. Save & Export
I used this way to share docker image with devs from other company that I worked with. </br>
I think we can deploy docker image this way when 2 other ways below is unapplicable. Like when we have to share docker image with those who use different network(with devs working in other company) so they are not able to access to our docker private registry, and when the codes are not to be opened in public so publishing the codes on the Docker Hub is not allowed.

### 2. Docker Hub


### 3. Docker Private Registry
