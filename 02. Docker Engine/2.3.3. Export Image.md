# 2.3.3. Export Image

We can save and move Docker Image as a single binary file by using <b>docker save</b> and <b>docker load</b>. </br>

```shell
docker save -o ubuntu_24_04.tar ubuntu:24.04
```

```shell
docker load -i ubuntu_24_04.tar
```

<br>
One drawback of this way is that it can't utilize the benefits of <b>Layer</b>. Docker image consists of number of layers. When we pull Docker image from registry, the image is pulled by each layer and docker skips the layer that already exists and only pull the layer that are updated. However by saving and loading, layer cache can't be used.
