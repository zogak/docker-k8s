# 2.2.4. Exposing Container

A Container is allocated virtual IP address like virtual machines. If nothing is set, the container is not accessible from the outside. </br>
In order to expose container's application, it is necessary to bind IP address and port of eth0 to those of host.
<br>
<br>
Option <b>-p</b> enables binding container's port to host's port.<br>
Format for option -p is : [host's port]:[container's port]

```shell
docker run -i -t -p 3306:3306 -p 192.168.0.100:7777:80 ubuntu:24.04
```

It is also possible to use many -p options to expose many ports, like the example above.
